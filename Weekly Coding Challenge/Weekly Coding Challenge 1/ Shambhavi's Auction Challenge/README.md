# Problem Statement
Shambhavi, the intrepid explorer, has unearthed N unique artifacts, each with an associated price, which she plans to sell at an auction.

On the auction day, M enthusiasts line up to purchase these artifacts.

Each enthusiast enters the room one by one and seeks to buy an artifact that fits within their budget and is the closest to Shambhavi's willing price for that artifiact.

Your task is to help Shambhavi manage this auction by assigning each enthusiast the most suitable artifact based on their budget constraints.

## Input Format
The first line contains two integers, N and M, representing the number of artifacts and the number of enthusiasts, respectively.

The second line contains N integers, the prices of the artifacts.

## Output Format
For each enthusiast, output the price of the artifact they purchase. If no artifact can be afforded within their budget, output -1.

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= M <= 10^5)

1 <= price of an artifact <= 10^9

1 <= budget of an enthusiast <= 10^9
