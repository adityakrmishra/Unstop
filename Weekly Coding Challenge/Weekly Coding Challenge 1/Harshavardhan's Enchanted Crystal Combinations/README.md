# Problem Statement
Once upon a time, in a mystical kingdom, there lived a wise young and smart wizard named Harshavardhan. Harshavardhan had an enchanted box that granted magical powers to anyone who could unlock it. To unlock this box, one had to find a combination of three magical crystals.

These crystals can have different power levels which can range from 1 to N, and need to be arranged in a way which follows a specific rule: the power level of the first crystal must be less than or equal to the second one, and the power level of the second crystal must be less than or equal to the third one.

Additionally, when combined together, their product must not exceed a magical limit ( N ).

Your task is to determine the number of valid combinations of these three crystals.

## Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer N representing the magical limit.

## Output Format
Display a single integer representing the number of valid combinations of these three crystals.

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^8

### Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
1
#### Testcase Output
1
## Explanation
The only valid triple is (1, 1, 1).

### Sample Testcase 1
#### Testcase Input
10
#### Testcase Output
16
## Explanation
The valid combinations are:



(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 4), (1, 1, 5), (1, 1, 6), (1, 1, 7), (1, 1, 8), (1, 1, 9), (1, 1, 10)
